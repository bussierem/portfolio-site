              I was introduced to Tabletop RPGs right before college in 2007 by some friends.
              They introduced me to Pathfinder, and I have been playing various RPGs consistently
              since then, with a wide variety of systems:<br />
              <strong>Medieval:</strong> D&D (3e, 3.5e, 4e, 5e), Pathfinder, Shadows of the Demon
              Lord, 13th Age, Iron Heroes<br />
              <strong>Cyberpunk:</strong> Shadowrun (4e, 5e), Cyberpunk v3<br />
              <strong>Warhammer 40k:</strong> Rogue Trader, Dark Heresy 2e, Only War, Freebootaz<br />
              <strong>World of Darkness:</strong> Hunter: The Vigil, Mage: The Awakening<br />
              <strong>Rules Light/One-shots:</strong> Everyone is John, Lasers and Feelings, All
              Outta Bubblegum, FATE, Dungeon World, Mythender<br />
              <strong>Misc:</strong> Monsters and Other Childish Things, Numenera, Feng Shui 2e,
              Savage Worlds (Deadlands)

            <th>Board Games</th>
            <td>
              I have played dozens of board games (I won't list these out) of all kinds,
              from the highly popular ones such as Ticket To Ride and Settlers of Catan, to
              more obscure ones like Epic Resort and Hirelings.  Playing all of these
              games has given me experience examining the systems of a game and finding
              problems, breaking points, and well-designed rules.

            <th>Dungeon Master</th>
            <td>
              I have been DMing Tabletop RPGs since 2008 - Right after learning to play,
              I immediately went to college and found a group, where I began my DM career.
              Since then I have DMed probably 90% of the systems I have played (listed
              above), and been able to DM in many different situations:  Online games,
              in-person games, games with adults, games with kids (I taught five 12y/o kids
              how to play Dungeon World, and it was a blast).<br />
              Out of all the games I have DMed, I would say maybe 40% have gone to a point
              I would call "campaign end", due to various reasons (the nebulous nature of
              online games being a primary factor).<br />
              Additionally, every game I have DMed for has had at least one person that
              was completely new to RPGs, and I have had the pleasure of teaching each one
              how to play, which has been a valuable experience itself.
              Finally, I have also created a number of custom worlds.  My style of DMing
              leans more towards "minimal prep improvisation", which allows me to make
              very fun adventures for my party on the fly, crafting enemies, quests, NPCs,
              and rewards whenever needed.

            <th>RPG Design</th>
            <td>
              During all my time playing different RPG systems, it has given me many chances
              to compare, contrast, and analyze the rulesets of these systems.  Doing so
              piqued my interest into making my own, and I have had numerous chances at
              varying levels of success (see <a href="rulesets.html">Rulesets</a> for an
              example of this).<br />
              Additionally, I have had a chance to deconstruct and try to "break" systems,
              with the help of my friend Tyler, allowing us to find the breakpoints in rules
              and even implement our own homebrew rules that "fix" things we find to be lacking.

            <td>
              My full-time career is as a software developer and tester.  I believe
              that this primary passion for programming has given me an analytical view,
              allowing me to deconstruct systems and truly enjoy learning and applying
              these rules.<br />
              Also, this career has given me the ability to make several tools and apps
              to be used in my RPGs - dice rollers, map generation, character creators, etc.

              An odd thing to have on a résumé, but here we are.  I pride myself on my
              spelling, grammar, and editing abilities - I have always been excellent at
              this, and I carry it over to whatever I work on.
